            <b class="text-blue-600"> ANSWER : </b>

            <p class="mt-3">
                In JavaScript, map(), filter(), forEach(), and find() are all higher-order array
                methods that allow developers to manipulate arrays in different ways.

                Here are the differences between them:

            <p class="mt-5 font-bold"> map(): map() applies a callback function to each element of an array and returns
                a new array with the
                same number of elements, where each element is the result of the callback function. It does not modify
                the original array.<br></p>

            <div class="mt-8 w-[700px] bg-blue-950 text-white p-5 rounded-md ml-4">
                const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];<br>
                const multipliedNumbers = numbers.map(number => number * 2); <br>
                console.log(multipliedNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] <br>
            </div>
            </p>


            <p class="mt-5 font-bold">
                filter(): filter() applies a callback function to each element of an array and returns a new array with
                only
                the elements that pass a certain condition defined by the callback function. It does not modify the
                original
                array.

            <div class="mt-8 w-[700px] bg-blue-950 text-white p-5 rounded-md ml-4">
                const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; <br>
                const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0); <br>
                console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4] <br>
            </div>

            </p>

            <p class="mt-5 font-bold">
                forEach(): forEach() applies a callback function to each element of an array and does not return
                anything.
                It simply executes the callback function on each element of the array. It does not modify the original
                array.


            <div class="mt-8 w-[700px] bg-blue-950 text-white p-5 rounded-md ml-4">
                const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];<br>
                numbers.forEach(number => console.log(number * 2)); // Output: 2 4 6 8 10<br>
            </div>
            </p>

            <p class="mt-5 font-bold">
                find(): find() applies a callback function to each element of an array and returns the first element
                that
                passes a certain condition defined by the callback function. If no element passes the condition, it
                returns
                undefined. It does not modify the original array.

            <div class="mt-8 w-[700px] bg-blue-950 text-white p-5 rounded-md ml-4">
                const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; <br>
                const evenNumber = numbers.find(number => number % 2 === 0); <br>
                console.log(evenNumber); // Output: 2 <br>

                cookies ? </h2>

            <b class="text-blue-600"> ANSWER : </b>

            <p class="mt-3">
                In web development, local storage, session storage, and cookies are used to store data on the
                client-side (i.e., on the user's computer). Here are the differences between them:

            <p class="mt-5 font-bold"> Local Storage: Local storage is a web storage API that allows you to store
                key-value pairs in the user's web browser. The data stored in local storage persists even after the user
                closes the web browser or restarts their computer. Local storage has a higher storage limit than cookies
                and can store up to 10MB of data. Local storage is scoped to the domain, which means that data stored in
                local storage by one domain cannot be accessed by another domain.<br></p>

            <div class="mt-8 w-[700px] bg-blue-950 text-white p-5 rounded-md ml-4">
                localStorage.setItem('key', 'value'); <br>
                const value = localStorage.getItem('key'); <br>

            </div>
            </p>


            <p class="mt-5 font-bold">
                Session Storage: Session storage is similar to local storage, but the data stored in session storage is
                deleted when the user closes the web browser. Session storage has the same storage limit as local
                storage (up to 10MB). Session storage is also scoped to the domain.

            <div class="mt-8 w-[700px] bg-blue-950 text-white p-5 rounded-md ml-4">
                sessionStorage.setItem('key', 'value'); <br>
                const value = sessionStorage.getItem('key'); <br>

            </div>

            </p>

            <p class="mt-5 font-bold">
                Cookies: Cookies are small text files that are stored in the user's web browser. Cookies can be used to
                store small amounts of data, such as user preferences or login information. Cookies can be persistent,
                which means they remain on the user's computer even after they close the web browser, or session-only,
                which means they are deleted when the user closes the web browser. Cookies are sent to the server with
                every HTTP request, which can impact performance. Cookies can also be limited in size, with a maximum
                size of 4KB per cookie.

            <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-3 text-center"> 3. What is event loop ? How does it works ? </h2>

            <b class="text-blue-600"> ANSWER : </b>
            <p class="mt-5 font-bold"> In JavaScript, the event loop is a mechanism that manages the execution of
                asynchronous code. The event loop is responsible for handling callbacks and events in the JavaScript
                runtime environment, which includes the web browser and Node.js.

                Here's how the event loop works:

                The JavaScript runtime environment maintains a call stack, which is a stack data structure that stores
                function calls. When a function is called, it is added to the top of the call stack, and when it
                returns, it is removed from the top of the call stack.

                When an asynchronous function is called (such as setTimeout() or an AJAX request), it is moved to the
                Web APIs (in a web browser) or to the Node.js APIs (in Node.js), which are separate from the call stack.

                When the asynchronous function is completed, it is moved to the callback queue.

                The event loop continuously checks the call stack to see if it is empty. If the call stack is empty, the
                event loop checks the callback queue for any queued callbacks.

                If there is a callback in the queue, the event loop moves it to the call stack, and the function
                associated with the callback is executed.

                The event loop continues this process, continuously checking the call stack and the callback queue,
                until there are no more callbacks to execute.

                This process allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous code in a non-blocking way, which means that other
                code can continue to execute while waiting for asynchronous code to complete. By using callbacks and the
                event loop, developers can write code that is responsive and efficient, even when dealing with
                long-running or time-consuming operations.

                In summary, the event loop is a mechanism that manages the execution of asynchronous code in JavaScript
                by maintaining a call stack and a callback queue, and continuously checking for callbacks to execute
                when the call stack is empty.
